# Biome Implementation Details

## Background & Rationale

### Problem Statement

The kouchou-ai project uses multiple frontend linting and formatting tools:

- **ESLint** — Code quality checks
- **Prettier** — Code formatting
- **Import sorters** — Inconsistent import organization

This **fragmented toolchain** creates:

- ❌ Slow CI/CD pipelines (multiple separate checks)
- ❌ Conflicting configurations (ESLint vs Prettier clashes)
- ❌ Inconsistent developer experience
- ❌ Maintenance burden (3+ config files)

### Solution: Biome

**Biome** unifies linting, formatting, and import sorting into a **single, Rust-based tool**:

- ✅ **Speed:** Orders of magnitude faster than ESLint + Prettier combined
- ✅ **Consistency:** Single configuration source of truth
- ✅ **Reduced Overhead:** No conflicting rule sets
- ✅ **Easy Adoption:** Works with zero-config defaults

---

## Architecture & Scope

### Included Directories

```
client/              # Next.js main frontend
client-admin/        # Next.js admin dashboard
client-build/        # Static build (same config as client)
```

### Excluded Directories

```
server/              # Python codebase (separate tooling)
node_modules/        # Dependencies (ignore)
.next/               # Build artifacts
dist/, build/        # Compiled output
experimental/        # Experimental code
```

### Configuration Strategy: Single Root `biome.json`

Instead of per-package configs, we use a **single root configuration** with directory-specific rules if needed.

**Advantages:**

- Consistent across all frontends
- Single source of truth
- Easier maintenance and updates

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–2)

### Goals

✅ Set up Biome configuration with minimal friction  
✅ Document adoption strategy  
✅ Make Biome checks non-blocking (warnings)

### Implementation Details

#### npm Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "biome check .",
    "lint:check": "biome check .",
    "lint:frontend": "biome check client client-admin client-build --write",
    "format": "biome check . --write"
  }
}
```

**Rationale:**

- `lint` and `lint:check` are synonymous for CI/CD flexibility
- `lint:frontend` targets only web directories (excludes server/Python)
- `format` auto-fixes formatting issues

#### Configuration: biome.json

```json
{
  "vcs": {
    "enabled": true,
    "clientKind": "git",
    "useIgnoreFile": true
  },
  "files": {
    "ignore": [
      "server",
      "node_modules",
      ".next",
      "dist",
      "build",
      "experimental"
    ]
  },
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true,
      "style": {
        "useFilenamingConvention": "off"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Settings:**

| Setting           | Value    | Reason                                   |
| ----------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `vcs.enabled`     | `true`   | Use `.gitignore` for automatic exclusion |
| `line_width`      | `100`    | Balance readability and modern screens   |
| `indent_width`    | `2`      | Consistent with Next.js default          |
| `quotes`          | `"`      | JavaScript convention                    |
| `semicolons`      | `always` | Explicit over implicit                   |
| `trailing_commas` | `all`    | ES5+ convention                          |

#### Disabled / Warning Rules (Phase 1)

| Rule                      | Severity | Rationale                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `useFilenamingConvention` | Off      | Legacy files use camelCase, kebab-case, and PascalCase |
| `noNonNullAssertion`      | Warn     | Existing codebase relies on non-null assertions        |
| `noExplicitAny`           | Warn     | Gradual TypeScript migration in progress               |
| `noBarrelFile`            | Off      | Intentionally used in component exports                |

**Why Warnings in Phase 1?**

- Allows developers to commit without failing checks
- Surfaces issues for future fixes
- Prevents CI/CD bottlenecks during adoption

#### GitHub Actions Workflow (Phase 1)

```yaml
name: Biome Lint (Report-Only)
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  biome:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18"
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint:check
```

**Phase 1 Behavior:**

- ✅ Runs on all PRs and pushes
- ✅ Reports issues as annotations
- ❌ Does NOT block merge (warning stage)

---

## Phase 2: Gradual Enforcement (Weeks 3–6)

### Goals

🎯 Migrate Biome from warnings to blockers  
🎯 Fix existing code issues  
🎯 Require new code to pass checks

### Actions

#### Escalate Rules to Errors

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "style": {
        "useFilenamingConvention": "warn", // Phase 1: off
        "noNonNullAssertion": "error" // Phase 1: warn
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Create Migration Branch

```bash
git checkout -b chore/biome-phase2-migration
npm run lint:frontend
# Commit fixes
```

Expected fixes:

- ~200–500 files reformatted
- 50–100 code quality issues identified
- 20–30 import organization fixes

#### Update CI/CD

```yaml
# .github/workflows/biome-lint.yml
- run: npm run lint:check
  # Now blocks PRs
```

#### Team Communication

- Send PR with automated fixes (formatting, imports)
- Announce Phase 2 kick-off
- Provide migration guide for teams

---

## Phase 3: Strict Enforcement (Weeks 7–10)

### Goals

🎯 Biome is mandatory  
🎯 All rules enforced as errors  
🎯 Zero technical debt from linting

### Actions

#### Final Rule Escalation

```json
{
  "linter": {
    "rules": {
      "recommended": true
      // All warnings → errors
    }
  }
}
```

#### Update Pre-commit Hook

```yaml
# lefthook.yml
lint:
  run: npm run lint
  stage: commit
  fail: true # Fail commit if Biome fails
```

#### Enforce in CI

```yaml
# .github/workflows/biome-lint.yml
- name: Biome Check
  run: npm run lint:check
  # Blocks merge on failure
```

## Integration Points

### Pre-commit Hook (lefthook)

**File:** `lefthook.yml`

Phase 1:

```yaml
lint:
  run: npm run lint --if-present
  fail: false # Non-blocking
```

Phase 3:

```yaml
lint:
  run: npm run lint --if-present
  fail: true # Blocks commit
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

**Phases 1–2:** Report-only  
**Phase 3:** Blocking

### IDE Integration

- **VS Code:** Install `biomejs.biome` extension
- **WebStorm:** Built-in Biome support

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Before Biome

- Separate ESLint, Prettier, import sorter
- 3+ config files to maintain
- Slow CI pipelines
- Inconsistent formatting

### After Biome (Phase 3)

- Single unified toolchain ✅
- One configuration file ✅
- Fast CI pipelines ✅
- Consistent code style ✅

### Metrics

- **Speed:** ~2x faster linting
- **Maintenance:** 1 config file vs. 3
- **Developer Time:** ~5 hrs/week saved (fewer CI failures, manual fixes)

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Breaking Changes Between Versions

**Mitigation:** Lock to `@biomejs/biome@^1.9.4` in `package.json`  
Use semantic versioning; test minor updates before upgrading

### Risk: Team Resistance

**Mitigation:**

- Non-blocking phase 1
- Clear communication about benefits
- Biome champion group for questions

### Risk: Slow Migration

**Mitigation:**

- Prioritize auto-fixable issues (formatting, imports)
- Use `--write` flag liberally
- Create focused migration branches

---

## Rollback Plan

If Biome causes issues:

```bash
# Remove Biome
npm uninstall @biomejs/biome

# Restore ESLint + Prettier
npm install --save-dev eslint prettier

# Update package.json scripts
"lint": "eslint ."
"format": "prettier --write ."
```

**Note:** We're confident Biome will succeed, but this safety net is available.

## FAQ

### Q: Will Biome replace ESLint entirely?

**A:** Yes, but gradually (Phase 1–3). All ESLint rules can be configured in Biome.

### Q: What about custom rules?

**A:** Biome focuses on recommended rules. For edge cases, fall back to comments:

```javascript
// biome-ignore lint/rule-name: reason
```

### Q: Can we run Biome alongside ESLint?

**A:** Not recommended; causes conflicts. Migrate fully to Biome (Phase 3).

### Q: Performance impact on CI?

**A:** Positive. Biome is ~10x faster than ESLint + Prettier combined.

### Q: What if we don't want to use Biome?

**A:** You can disable it by removing the npm scripts and CI job. However, we recommend adopting it for consistency and speed.

## CI/CD Behavior (GitHub Actions)

### Workflow File

The `.github/workflows/biome-lint.yml` workflow runs Biome on all PRs and pushes to `main` and `develop`.

### Key Features

#### 1. Minimal Permissions (Security)

The workflow uses the **least privilege** permission model:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write
```

This allows:

- ✅ Reading repository contents
- ✅ Writing comments on PRs (from the main repository)
- ❌ Blocks: Creating commits, modifying deployments, etc.

#### 2. Fork PR Handling

For security, GitHub intentionally restricts `GITHUB_TOKEN` for forked PRs. The workflow detects this and **skips posting comments** to avoid 403 errors:

```yaml
if: >-
  github.event_name == 'pull_request' &&
  github.event.pull_request.head.repo.fork == false
```

**Behavior:**

- **Main Repo PRs:** Biome results posted as a comment; always visible
- **Forked PRs:** Comment skipped (security); results still in logs and summary

#### 3. Changed Files Optimization

The workflow uses `tj-actions/changed-files` to detect which files were modified:

```yaml
files: |
  client/**
  client-admin/**
  client-static-build/**
  package.json
  biome.json
```

**Behavior:**

- If only non-frontend files changed → Biome skips (saves CI time)
- If frontend files or config changed → Biome runs
- On `push` to main/develop → Always runs (full check)

#### 4. Phase 1: Non-Blocking

The workflow uses `continue-on-error: true`, so:

- ✅ Biome warnings don't block PR merging
- ✅ Results appear in logs and PR comments
- ✅ Job always passes (Phase 1 behavior)

In Phases 2–3, remove `continue-on-error` to enforce strict linting.

### Troubleshooting CI Failures

#### Issue: "403 Resource not accessible by integration"

**Cause:** Attempting to comment on a forked PR (security restriction).  
**Fix:** The workflow now skips comments for forked PRs automatically. No action needed.

#### Issue: Biome check fails locally but passes in CI

**Cause:** Different versions or caching issues.  
**Fix:**

```bash
npm ci                    # Clean install
npm run lint:check        # Run locally
```

#### Issue: Changed files detection not working

**Cause:** `fetch-depth: 0` missing or action outdated.  
**Fix:** The workflow includes `fetch-depth: 0` to fetch full history. Update action if needed:

```bash
gh workflow run biome-lint.yml
```
